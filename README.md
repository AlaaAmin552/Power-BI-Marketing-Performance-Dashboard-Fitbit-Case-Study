# Marketing Campaign Performance Dashboard ‚Äì Power BI Case Study (Fitbit Data)
A comprehensive marketing analytics project using Power BI to evaluate Fitbit campaign performance. It includes dynamic KPI calculations, AM/PM time analysis, top campaign insights, and business-driven recommendations‚Äîall presented through an interactive, multi-page dashboard built entirely from scratch

##  Project Overview

Marketing campaigns are only as good as their measurable results. This project focuses on answering critical marketing performance questions using real campaign data:

- How effective are the campaigns in generating audience engagement?
- Which time frames (AM/PM) lead to higher conversions?
- What are the top-performing campaigns and what contributes to their success?
- Where can marketers optimize targeting, content, and timing?

The entire report was built from scratch using Power BI, with an emphasis on dynamic interaction, smart filtering, and insightful visuals.


## üìä Key Performance Metrics (KPIs)

### üßÆ Calculated Metrics:

- **Click Through Rate (CTR)** = Clicks / Impressions  
  Indicates how appealing the ad is to the audience.

- **Conversion Rate** = Conversions / Clicks  
  Reflects the efficiency of converting interest into action.

- **Total Conversions**  
- **Total Conversion Value**  
- **Total Clicks & Impressions**  
- **Number of Platforms**  
- **Customer Count (Unique IDs)**  
- **Campaign Count (Campaign IDs)**

Each metric was developed using DAX measures to ensure they respond dynamically to user interaction and slicers in the dashboard.


##  Dashboard Components

The dashboard is structured to guide the user through layers of analysis:

- **KPI Summary Cards**: High-level view of all performance indicators.
- **Decomposition Tree**: Used to drill into performance factors like campaign, platform, and time.
- **AM/PM Analysis**: Split dayparts to identify optimal advertising windows.
- **Top Campaign Table**: Ranked list of best-performing campaigns by conversion value.
- **Conditional Formatting**: Visually enhanced performance zones within charts.
- **Q&A Visuals**: AI-powered insights for natural-language exploration.
- **Navigation Page**: Multi-page structure for smoother experience.
- **Final Insight Box**: Business recommendations based on trends and patterns discovered.


##  Analytical Insights

This dashboard helped extract business-driven insights such as:

- High CTR doesn't always correlate with high conversion, highlighting a need to analyze post-click user experience.
- Some platforms consistently outperform others depending on the time of day.
- Top 3 campaigns revealed recurring strengths in targeting and platform allocation.

Recommendations based on these insights were added at the end of the dashboard in a well-formatted summary section.
